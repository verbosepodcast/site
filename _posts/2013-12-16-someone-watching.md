####Episode 7
###Somebody's Watching Me

Between the NSA watching our every move, and us watching our users every move (via analytics), our collective paranoia has never been higher. Also: we discuss how animation principles can be applied to making better user interfaces in our apps. We also briefly mention Anchorman 2, which none of us have actually seen yet.
