##Episode 9: Sporadic, My Ass

In which we deny rumours of our sporadic output, we get in a flap about app-flipping, we make insulting comments about known homophobes, racists and each other, and we discuss security and encryption in relation to mobile app data.
And for the first time on Verbose, there's an after-show section! We basically just forgot to stop the recording and continued to drink beer.

#### Shownotes:

* The depressingly profitable practice of [flipping apps](http://www.bluecloudsolutions.com/blog/money-apps-turn-1k-200k-portfolio/).
* Dungeon Keeper's horrible usage of IAPs, and slightly more reasonable approach to dissuading users from leaving negative reviews, and instead leaving useful feedback for the developer.
