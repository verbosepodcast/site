##Episode 8: Resolute and Predictable

In which we square our chins, gird our loins, bare our teeth and turn our gaze to the future. It’s not a good look for any of us. We talk a little about some of our crowd-sourced resolutions and predictions for the new year, some of which may prove to be more elusive than others.

#### Shownotes:
