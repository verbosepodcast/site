##Episode 11: Bleeding Hearts

In which we talk of bleeding hearts and retaining data, freedom of information and what Kickstarter really owes to their contributors.

#### Shownotes:

* The [WWDC Ticket Lottery](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/)! One of us is ecstatically happy about being given the opportunity to pay Apple a lot of money for a week in San Francisco, the other two less so.
* [Heartbleed](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/04/heartbleed.html) is discussed, including revoking our servers cigarettes.
* Data retention law in the EU [kicked into touch](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26935096).
* A brief mention of GCHQ means that porn becomes a topic of discussion for several minutes again.

* Oculus Rift’s [purchase](http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/25/5547946/welcome-to-planet-facebook) by Facebook, and how all the Kickstarter contributors get to feel about that. 
* Karl’s Laugh attempts to launch his own [space rocket](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1108292587/3d-printed-aerospike-rocket-engine), powered by solely by inhumanly loud laughter.
